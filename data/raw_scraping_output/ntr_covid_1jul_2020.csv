In the described context of possible benefits but still uncertain risks, we on purpose perform a double blinded phase 2/3  RCT to investigate both safety and effectivity of early in the disease course administrated convalescent plasma in patients with COVID-19. The latter patients are sick enough to warrant hospitalization but have not (yet) experienced overwhelming disease including a systemic inflammatory response, sepsis, and/or ARDS warranting ventilation and (eminent) ICU referral.  

Study population:
This study will enrol adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, who have been recently  (not more than 3 days) hospitalized, but are not admitted to the ICU or expected to go to the ICU within 6 hours of first plasma administration.

Intervention:
Enrolled patients will either receive convalescent thawed fresh frozen plasma 1 unit (250-325 ml) (=treatment group) or standard thawed fresh frozen plasma 1 unit (250-325 ml) (=control group)

Study endpoints: 
The estimated benefit in regard of the primary endpoint is a shift in the distribution of the scores towards less mortality, mechanical ventilation, ICU admission and shorter than the presently mean hospital stay (see figure). The primary endpoint will be analyzed using a Bayesian proportional odds model. Posterior probabilities will start to be computed after 20 patients have completed their follow-up and will be computed on regular basis afterwards. 
The endpoints can be summarized as following:
= Ordinal outcome of all cause mortality, mechanical ventilation, ICU admission and long duration of hospital stay (6 days or more), with less than 6 hospitalized days as reference category will be used for the primary outcome. The outcome will be primarily assessed at day 14.

Digital counselling

The digital counselling modules for intervention group are described below:
 
-Screening for reduced physical fitness. If there are signs for a decreased physical condition we will refer the patient, after consultation, for a digital intake with our physiotherapist. The patients then get access to a digital module with information and videos of physical exercise training. The patient gets a trainings schedule and we will contact the patient after about 1 and 3 weeks to check their progression and to give additional advice when needed. 
 
-Screening for smoking. If the patient smokes and is motivated to quit smoking, we will refer, after consultation, for a digital intake with one of our stop smoking nurses. Then, a digital and telephone supported counselling will start after an informed and shared decision making with the nurse. When needed, supportive medication can be prescribed. 
 
-Screening for malnutrition and obesity. If there are signs of malnutrition (MUST-score) or obesity (BMI >30) we will refer the patient, after consultation, for a digital intake with a dietician. The patients then get access to a digital module with information about a healthy diet. We will contact the patient ever 2 weeks in case of malnutrition and every 4 weeks in case of obesity. In the case of malnutrition the dietician can prescribe protein rich nutrition supplements when needed. 
 
-Screening for anxiety and depression. If there are signs for anxiety and depression, we will refer the patient, after consultation, for a digital intake with a psychological assistant. The patients then get access to a digital platform with information and exercises. The assistant will guide the patient and will provide digital support after 1 and 3 weeks. 
 
-Screening for elevated pulmonary risk score. When patients have an elevated risk score for adverse pulmonary complications (pulmonary risk score for cardiac surgery patients questionnaire) we will refer the patient, after consultation, for a digital intake with our physiotherapist. The patients then get access to a digital module with information and videos of pulmonary exercise training. We will send a inspiratory muscle trainer (IMT) to the patient to perform daily exercises.

Most patients undergoing a cardiovascular procedure need an IC-bed during the hospitalization and therefore it is possible that for the unforeseen future, because of the Covid-19 crisis, many patients will stay on the waiting list for many months to come. There are some studies showing an increased mortality associated with an increased waiting time for the patients on the waiting list for an elective cardiac surgery. However, there is no data on the evolution of the morbidity, the quality of life and the symptomatology of the patients waiting for an elective operation. Also it is not clear whether the period of waiting for an elective cardiovascular operation would impact the morbidity or the mortality of the planned operation at later stage. Furthermore, there is a plethora of studies on risk factors associated with the perioperative morbidity and mortality in general. 
Therefore, the rationale of the current study is to evaluate whether Digital Cardiac Counseling (DCC) would improve outcomes of the patients waiting for an elective cardiac operation. At the DCC platform, there will be assessments of cardiovascular symptoms, Covid-19 prevention for cardiovascular patients, smoking cessation, anxiety relief, exercise stimulation, pulmonary rehabilitation and diet adjustments. This will be done by means of questionnaires and E-consults. 
We start this project now because of two reasons. First, the prolonged waiting list due to the Covid pandemic creates the opportunity to use this period for cardiac prehabilitation. Second, it is only recently that we got the possibility to use a digital platform, which is ideal in this period of social distancing. 

Objective: 
Primary Objective: 
-What is the effect of an interactive Digital Cardiac Counseling platform with E-consulting on cumulative incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) at 1 year after the cardiac surgery compared to the control condition (no interactive Digital Cardiac Counseling)?

Secondary Objective(s): 
- What is the effect of an interactive Digital Cardiac Counseling platform with E-consulting on patient-measured outcomes during treatment delay due to the Covid-19 pandemic measured just before, and 1 year after the cardiac surgery compared to the control condition (no interactive Digital Cardiac Counseling)?

Study design: 
Randomized controlled trial
We will use random permuted block size if technically feasible otherwise with random block sizes of 4, 6, and 8. The randomization will be computer-based and will generate two groups. Both groups will get access to the Digital Cardiac Counseling platform and both groups will complete the same set of validated questionnaires at the same time intervals. The intervention groups will get additional training modules and E-consulting based on the risk assessment retrieved from the completed questionnaires. 
Study population: 
The patient population will include any adult patient on the waiting list for any elective cardiovascular operation in MUMC during Covid-19 pandemic.

Intervention: 
All participants will receive at the different time intervals through our custom-made Digital Cardiac Counseling platform different questionnaires related to the different known risk factors for the perioperative cardiac care and measured outcomes. 
Additional to above participants in the intervention group will receive through the Digital Cardiac Counseling platform different modules with E-counseling for risk factors evaluated in the questionnaires. Additional to known risk factors a Covid-19 module will be used as well.

Main study parameters/endpoints: 
The primary endpoint is cumulative incidence of MACE (Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events) at 1 year after cardiac surgery. The primary outcome is the difference in percentage of patients that experienced Mace at 1-year follow-up postoperatively. We expect that approximately 20% of patients in the control group will experience an event. We will include 197 patients per group, or 394 in total, to be able to have 80% power to detect a difference in MACE of 10% between groups in favor of the intervention group, using an alpha of 0.05.

The number of confirmed cases continues to rise, leading to significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Although individuals of any age can acquire SARS-CoV-2, adults of middle and older age are most commonly affected. Moreover, recent reports demonstrate that mortality rates rise significantly among patients 60 years and older. Therefore, strategies to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection or to reduce its clinical consequences in elderly are desperately needed. Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine not only protects against tuberculosis, but has also been shown to induce protection against various respiratory infections, including those with a viral aetiology, leading to significant reductions in morbidity and mortality.

Up to 20% of COVID-19 patients on the general ward may require ICU admission for hypoxic respiratory failure and are predominantly admitted during the night. We hypothesize that predominantly sleeping in the non-supine position could improve oxygenation and thereby shorten the disease course.

Study design: Randomized, placebo-controlled single-center study.
Study population: Patients aged ≥ 18 years, admitted to the hospital ward with a proven SARS-CoV-2 infection, suffering from COVID-19.
Intervention (if applicable): Prevent a supine position during sleep by the use of a Sleep Position Trainer, a small wearable device that trains patients to not sleep on their back by using gentle vibrations (1:1 randomization). In both groups sleep position will be continuously registered.

Because of its common routine use in clinical anaesthesia, there is extensive experience with the use of isoflurane.

Pneumonia due to SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov2, COVID-19) is characterised by bilateral ground-glass opacities comparable with the radiological and clinical characteristics that are often encountered in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia frequently require high inspiratory oxygen concentrations to avoid hypoxemia. In contrast to ARDS, the compliance of the respiratory system of patients with COVID-19 often remains normal. Therefore, it is postulated that these patients benefit from moderate positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) to recruit lung tissue and to decrease right-to-left shunt. PEEP can be delivered noninvasively as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) via a face mask in conjunction with high inspiratory oxygen fractions. 
Objective: 
To evaluate the physiological effects, feasibility, tolerability and safety of CPAP via a face mask in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring high inspired oxygen fractions during spontaneous breathing. 
Study design: 
Cross-over phase 1 intervention study. Patients are first monitored during conventional oxygen support via a non-rebreathing mask (standard of care) and are subsequently crossed over to an open-circuit face mask with CPAP 0 cmH2O and the same face mask with CPAP 7.5 cmH2O. Each modality is applied for 30 minutes. 
Study population: 
Hospitalised COVID-19 patients with a transcutaneous O2 saturation of 90% or less at 5 l/min oxygen administration via nasal canula.
Intervention: Delivery of supplemental oxygen via the face mask with inlet for inspired oxygen delivery and outlet with viral/bacterial filter and a PEEP valve that keeps the system under pressure (7.5 cmH2O). 
Three conditions are tested (each lasting 30 min, the ‘measurement period’): 
1. Oxygen delivery via a nonrebreathing mask (current standard of care) with sufficient inflow of O2 (which does not create PEEP).  
2. Oxygen delivery via the face mask with zero PEEP in order to test the effect of the mask alone. 
3. Oxygen delivery via the face mask with PEEP of 7.5 cmH2O in order to test effect of moderate PEEP. 
Main study parameters/endpoints: 
The primary endpoint of the study is a change in the combination of oxygen saturation (measured by pulse oximetry, SpO2) and respiratory rate. The use of this combination of variables is substantiated by a recent study showing that the ratio of SpO2 divided by FIO2 (mean inspiratory O2 fraction) and RR are predictors of failure on high flow oxygen therapy. The combination of SpO2 and RR is important as a patient may respond positively through either an improvement of oxygenation (improved ventilation-perfusion matching in the lung or diminished diffusion disorder) or a reduction in respiratory rate.

Rationale: Currently there are no approved treatments for COVID-19. In the Dutch treatment protocol guideline (SWAB) designated treatment options are chloroquine base (CQ), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and the standard treatment alone. CQ and HCQ are implemented because of their in vitro activity, results from small animal studies, and anecdotal patient’s data. There are no published randomized studies with these medications in patients with disease caused by any coronavirus.

Objective: To evaluate if treatment with one of two antiviral agents versus no antiviral treatment results in less disease progression in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 who require hospital admission.

Study design: Multicentre, cluster-randomized cross-over, open label trial.
Hospitals will be randomly allocated to one of 3 treatment arms in sequential periods of one week: chloroquine base versus hydroxychloroquine versus no antiviral agent without any drug presumed active against SARS-COV-2. Patients will be treated based on the date of admission.

Study population: Adults aged of 18 years and older with moderate to severe, with a NEWS-2 score ≤ 5, laboratory confirmed COVID-19, who require hospital admission in a ward outside the Medium Care/Intensive Care.
 
Intervention (if applicable): Depending on the treatment arm, the study subject will be treated with one of the two antiviral agents (chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine). Patients in the control group will not receive any antiviral treatment active against SARS-Cov-2.

Main study parameters/endpoints: Disease progression defined as a NEWS-2 score ≥ 7 within 14 days, or admission to Medium Care or Intensive Care Unit, or death. 

Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: Burden: The burden for the patient will be the initial inclusion in this trial and the possible telephonic contact after discharge from the hospital. All other data will be collected through routine care. 
Risk and benefit: All three arms are currently implemented as possible treatment for COVID-19, without preference for a treatment. Therefore patients are not exposed to an additional risk. The possible benefit of one arm will be accounted for with monitoring.
